<br>
<strong>ALF e.V.</strong> is a registered non-profit (<i>eingetragener Verein</i>) based in WÃ¼rzburg, Germany.
<p> </p>

In 2017, as the ALF code matured, was openly released, and management increasingly required more resources, we sought ways to make the open-source project sustainable in the long run. Early support from the <a href="https://www.dfg.de/en">DFG</a> (German Research Foundation), starting in 2019, evolved into ALF Association being founded in 2022, with the goal of ensuring ALF's sustainability based on the support from the scientific community.


### Motivation

While writing new research software and using it for science might be funded by research grants, funding opportunities for **maintaining** established research software are scarce. Therefore, one of our key tasks is to raise funds to promote the project's continued growth.

We dedicate our resources to the package's:
<ul>
<li>maintenance</li>
<li>improvement and</li>
<li>user base support and growth</li>
</ul>


### Activities

The association plays an important role in, among others, the realization of ALF User Workshops (e.g., <a href="https://alfworkshop2024.sciencesconf.org/">2024 Workshop</a>), in advancing associated projects (e.g., Python interface <a href="https://git.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/pyALF">pyALF</a> and library <a href="http://gitpages.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/alf/hamiltonians/front.html">model Hamiltonians</a>) and in obtaining additional resources (e.g., <a href="https://unitary.fund/grants/">Unitary Fund</a>).
<p> </p>

Its staff responsibilities range from code development to community building and it is responsible for tending ALF's <a href="mailto:alf@physik.uni-wuerzburg.de?subject=ALF-eV  Membership">e-mail</a>, its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ALF-QMC">YouTube channel</a>, the community's <a href="https://discord.gg/VppWWEPMHa">Discord server</a> as well as the package's <a href="https://alf.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/">website</a>.


### Members

Most members of ALF e.V. are main contributors or users of the ALF package. The list of members is not public, but there is some overlap with the [ALF Collaboration](https://gitpages.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/ALF_Webpage/page/team/).
