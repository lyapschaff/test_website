<br>

ALF is an open-source package that provides a high-performance implementation of the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. It is anchored in the domain of material science, artificial quantum systems (cold atoms), and more broadly quantum technologies.
<p></p>

The package has attracted quite some interest due to the very general definition of the model that allows for simulations of a wide range of quantum systems. It has lead to dozens of publications and our user base includes an international set of groups located around the world (ETHZ, Princeton, Perimeter, Weizmann, MPIPKS, University of Rio de Janeiro, University of Beijing, University of Hong-Kong, National university of Singapore, etc).
